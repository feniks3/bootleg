Bootleg is a Final Fantasy VII program that applies every single mod available to make installing easier.

More information can be found at http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=12008.0

The Bootleg project is led by the Brat team, whose members are:

PitBrat (main coder);
Vgr (debugger and beta-tester);
EQ2Alyza (tutorial-maker and problem-solver);

We have an IRC channel, on irc.esper.net channel #VGR

Channel info:

PitBrat, Vgr and geraldbrent have full control over the channel, given they are around
All the other ops, except Faerie and Samantha, have control over anything else
Faerie and Samantha are both bots (ChanServ and eggdrop, respectively)

For any moderation issue (hopefully none) and any help that isn't related to Bootleg, you can join #Vgr-staff on irc.esper.net

When on the channel, you can use mau5bot's "tell" feature to send a message to anyone (like PitBrat or Vgr). For example, to tell Vgr that you want to talk to him, you can use the form ".tell Vgr I'd like to talk to you" (the form is ".tell 

&lt;nick&gt;

 

&lt;message&gt;

"). It is recommended to put your email address or forum account if you want a quick reply. If not, you might have to come back often to check for any answer.

UPDATE!

Bootleg 040 now has a built-in link to the IRC chatroom.

Notes: In the downloads, you will also see downloads to a certain "Wolfbot" (usually with timestamps). These are NOT related to Bootleg, but are a python 3.2 free IRC bot for the common game of Werewolf. It is maintained and regularly updated by Vgr, and ran by Raiden, admin of server chaos.esper.net (on irc.esper.net). To play, you can join the channel #Werewolf on irc.esper.net to play, or follow this easy link: http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=Werewolf&nick=

On request, I will add features to the bot. Please note that I am quite satisfied as it is, but there is always room for improvement.
